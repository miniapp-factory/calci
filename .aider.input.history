+Code the following app
+```
+The mini app named Calci is a calculator application designed to perform mathematical computations.
+
+🔢 Core Functionality
+As a calculator, Calci's primary function is to handle various arithmetic operations. This typically includes:
+
+Basic Arithmetic: Addition (+), Subtraction (−), Multiplication (×), and Division (÷).
+
+Input/Output: Providing a digital interface for users to input numbers and operators and displaying the calculated results.
+
+📱 Typical Features (Depending on Complexity)
+While the core purpose is calculation, a mini app like Calci might include several features to enhance its utility:
+
+Standard Mode: Focuses on simple, day-to-day calculations.
+
+Scientific Mode: Includes more advanced functions for scientific or engineering tasks, such as:
+
+Trigonometric functions (sin,cos,tan)
+
+Logarithmic functions (log,ln)
+
+Exponents and Roots (x 
+y
+ , 
+x
+
+​
+ )
+
+Constants (e.g., π)
+
+Memory Functions: Tools to store, recall, add to, or subtract from a calculated value (M+, M-, MR, MC).
+
+History/Log: The ability to review previous calculations.
