```
The mini app named Calci is a calculator application designed to perform mathematical computations.

🔢 Core Functionality
As a calculator, Calci's primary function is to handle various arithmetic operations. This typically includes:

Basic Arithmetic: Addition (+), Subtraction (−), Multiplication (×), and Division (÷).

Input/Output: Providing a digital interface for users to input numbers and operators and displaying the calculated results.

📱 Typical Features (Depending on Complexity)
While the core purpose is calculation, a mini app like Calci might include several features to enhance its utility:

Standard Mode: Focuses on simple, day-to-day calculations.

Scientific Mode: Includes more advanced functions for scientific or engineering tasks, such as:

Trigonometric functions (sin,cos,tan)

Logarithmic functions (log,ln)

Exponents and Roots (x 
y
 , 
x

​
 )

Constants (e.g., π)

Memory Functions: Tools to store, recall, add to, or subtract from a calculated value (M+, M-, MR, MC).

History/Log: The ability to review previous calculations.
```
